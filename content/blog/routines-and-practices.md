title: Routines and Practices
description: Working the groves to reduce mental energy
---
By establishing routines and practices, we reduce the mental energy needed to do useful work. By automating the reflex to "do the thing", we minimize the back and forth mental "geeing up" needed.\
\
Whether it's psyching ourselves up to get out of a warm bed to go for a run, or meditating at 9am each day, each repetition of a habit deepens the grove that helps keep us on the tracks.
