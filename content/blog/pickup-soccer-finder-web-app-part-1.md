title: Pickup Soccer Finder Web App - Part 1
description: Embarking on building a web app, figuring out how to work, and showing my work.
---
As a soccer player, the joy of being able to find people to play with is part of the furniture. When I first moved to Philadelphia, the first group of friends I made was playing pickup soccer. My partner was part of that initial friend group.

While there are rec soccer and tournaments for young professionals, slickly produced to extract sign-ups fees for the perpetual promise of a champions trophy and a free t-shirt, nothing beats pickup soccer.

The joy of showing up at a pre-established location (usually done via some long email chain), waiting around for an unspoken head count to be met, before awkwardly dividing into teams and getting things going.

This is where the idea for building my first web app comes from: PickupSoccerFinder.com. An easy-to-use app to find pickup soccer games near you.

## The Process

Given this is the first app I'm making, I, of course, have no idea what I'm doing. Building a process will be as important as learning and building the skills required for the project. By **showing my work**, I plan to document the in-flux nature of the process - both as a way, hopefully to provide value to readers, but also as a means for me to look back on what I was thinking and planning along the way.

I have no idea how long any of this will take...
