Since I last wrote about my project, I've changed my approach somewhat.

## What's changed?

I originally had notions of learning React.js and getting into the weeds there. But in the interests of *shipping the work*, I decided to build this project using Gatsby (itself built on React), since I've already had experience with it (this website is built on Gatsby) and there are plenty of plugins to help.

## Where are things at now?

Currently, I'm in the process of building out the basic bones of the site - the various levels of landing pages - as well as wrestling with MongoDB to use as the backend to store all the pickup game data.

## What's been hard?

Taking the time to sit down and get into what Cal Newport would call "[Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)" has been tough. When you are a beginner, it can be difficult to know where to start and how to prioritize what needs to be done. Also, is it better to build and do the art quickly to ship? Or to take the time to learn and fully understand the technologies that underlie the project?

Mainly though, finding (or rather *making*) consistent time to work on the project has been a struggle. Between work and the holidays, I'm hoping the new year (and all the fresh slate hoopla that brings) will be an inflection point for me.
