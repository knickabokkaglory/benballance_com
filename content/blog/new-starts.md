description: Placing importance on specific days for new starts.

Birthdays, anniversaries, new years. We place a lot of importance on arbitrary days. As though they are an opportunity to start something new, to re-invent ourselves.

In reality, every day is an opportunity to do this. To draw a line, to begin again, to commit to a new habit or practice.
