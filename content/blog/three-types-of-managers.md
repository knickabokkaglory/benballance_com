There are three types of manager I've encountered so far in my career:

There are people who have been doing the same job you're doing now, just longer. And, as a result, are there to supervise your work and give it a stamp of approval. These managers are most common.

There are people who have been at the company for longer than you. By sheer inertia, they have risen to where they are without any real skill or talent or even desire for the role. These are the managers to avoid.

Then, there are people for whom leading seems to be baked into them. They have the innate ability to move projects along, corral stakeholders and ideas, all the while providing value to whoever the company's users are. These are the managers to seek out.
