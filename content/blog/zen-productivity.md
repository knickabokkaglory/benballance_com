description: Moving toward more mindful productivity in 2021

A focus for me this year will be to be more mindful in the tasks I complete at work - both in terms of what I chose to get done and how I get it done. Inspired by Leo Babauta's [Zen to Done](https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/) framework, I've begun instituting several behaviors into how I work:

1. Establishing clear points throughout the day for task collection, processing, and categorization.

2. Selecting 3 or so "big rocks" at the beginning of the week that, if they are completed, would make it a successful week.

3. Selecting 3 or so "most important tasks" at the beginning of each day that, if they are completed, would make it a successful day.

4. When I'm working on tasks, try to make that the only thing I do. That means closing the email tab, closing the chat tab and really diving in to the task at hand.
