The first live professional soccer games since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak were played yesterday in Germany. There were no fans in the stadium. Coaches and substitute players sat at appropriate distances from each other wearing masks. You could hear every players' shout as the ball pinged around the field.

It was an eerie approximation of the usual experience of watching a game. What was most striking were the elements that remained close to the original. Players still celebrated scoring goals by bumping elbows and grinning at each other from an awkwardly appropriate distance. At the end of the game in Dortmund, players raised their hands toward the famous *Südtribüne* stand at one end of the stadium. Except the stand was completely empty.

The performative aspects of the game remained because that's what they are: performative. Winning a game still counts without the celebration with fans, but does the performance of winning validate winning?
