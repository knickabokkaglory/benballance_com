If I was to learn about SEO from the beginning, here's what I'd do:

### Learn the basics

Read through a general SEO guide from beginning to end. There are a few good ones out there from the likes of [Moz](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo) and [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-basics/). It's not vital that you remember everything you learn in these guides. Bookmark them so you can come back and use them as a resource.

### Make a website of your own

Try to find a CMS that isn't just drag and drop. One that requires you to read documentation and figure things out. [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) is a good place to start. Take the things you've learned in your reading and build a website that provides value to an audience. Make sure your site is technically sound - find plugins to help you with meta data, robots.txt files, and XML sitemaps.

### Find a volunteer project to work on

There are plenty of non-profit organizations looking for volunteers with SEO know-how to help improve their site. Check out [Catchafire](https://www.catchafire.org/) and find a client you can help. Follow your process, find opportunities, and deliver value to your new client. They'll be grateful you did.
