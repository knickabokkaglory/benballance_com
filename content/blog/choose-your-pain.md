title: Choose Your Pain
description: Thoughts on choosing your pain.

[James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) writes about the idea of "choosing your pain". The idea being that pain, in life, is unavoidable. But by the choices and decisions we make, we can often  choose the form that pain takes.

For instance, I can either be proactive at work, hustling people for follow-ups etc., or I can choose to be reactive. 

Here is the quote from James Clear:

*"Many people delay taking action because they hope to avoid suffering. They keep searching for a path that wonâ€™t involve tradeoffs.*

*But some form of suffering is always inevitable. The process of taking action is the process of choosing your pain."*

Trusting that the process will involve some form of pain harkens back to Stoic ideas as well. Hard work is fraught with discomfort, but that it is within that discomfort that we find growth, find progress and do good work - [the obstacle is the way!](https://dailystoic.com/obstacle-is-the-way-summary/)

By choosing the pain, we are able to beat the game. By formulating strategies around which pain we choose, we lessen the pain that less useful - the pain where it's harder to come to any actionable conclusion from other than "I messed up".

One stance too is to lean into the pain of our choosing. By being more mindful and selective about how we take action - the path that we take - we can better prepare our minds to confront that pain. By delaying action, we are postponing the preparation of that pain - allowing and enabling it to sneak up on us when we are not prepared. To make an enemy of it instead of choosing it as a friend, a rival, and a tutor.
