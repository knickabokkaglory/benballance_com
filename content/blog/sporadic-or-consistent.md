title: Sporadic or Consistent
description: Being consistent over pulling the all-nighter.
---
Sporadic is the all-nighter to write the paper you hadn't started. Sporadic is the avoidance of the work until the last possible minute, until you realize you have to get something out the door.\
\
Consistent is working on the paper every day, so that you only have to polish by the time it's due to be handed in.
