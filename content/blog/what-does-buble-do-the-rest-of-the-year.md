title: What Does Buble Do the Rest of the Year?
description: Thinking about people who are tied to times or events.
---
There are certain people who have woven themselves into the cultural fabric in such a way that they cycle into our view only periodically. A few examples:

* The only time I think about Michael Buble is around Christmas. I have no idea what he does the rest of the year.
* Bob Costas appears once every 4 years to front Olympics coverage.
* For many cricket fans, the voices of the Test Match Special commentary team signify the start of summer each year.

These people have created a personal brand that is intrinsically tied to the context we attach to them.

So much so that we get a visceral reaction when something breaks this spell. Like the time Bob Costas contracted pink eye during the Olympics.

While these personalities certainly have their niche cornered, our attachments are also cornering them.
