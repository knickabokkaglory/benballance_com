title: Thoughts on SEO
description: Thinking about the value of SEO as an SEO practitioner.

## **Something I read recently that shook me:**

*"SEO is the practice of ranking high in the search results for a generic term. A locksmith or a hotel or a doctor who wins their generic search will earn a huge profit. But everyone is is left to spend money on consultants and trickery to somehow rank higher. The math can't support this pyramid scheme.*

*On the other hand, a smart marketer can build a product or service that's worth searching for. Not the generic term, but to find you. the thing you built, the specific. When you do that, Google's on your side. They actually want you to be found when someone searches for you.*

*Step one is to make a product or service that people care enough to search for specifically. You cannot win in a generic search, but you'll always win if the search is specific enough.*

*And then step two is easy to understand: to be the one they want to find when they go looking."*

## **Why this shook me:**

* This feels like truth
* SEO isn't marketing, it is the optimization of an online presence.
* (At least, according to Seth, but I think I agree with this) The marketing is the idea, the trust, the service. The best SEO can hope to accomplish is increase the fringes of that visibility.
* SEO does not change anyone's online life or positively impacting culture. It is the experiences that do this. We, as SEO practitioners, frame things in terms of answering people's questions. But are we really finding new questions to answer most of the time? Or are we finding existing questions that are already there and looking to answer them in a way that is comparable to how they've already been asked?
* I feel far more excited about the thought of ideas and new experiences for an audience than uncovering potential topic areas. Yes, SEO is a component of "marketing", but it is the optimization of the marketing around an existing idea or brand, instead of "marketing" or "digital marketing" itself. Or perhaps "digital marketing" isn't the digital version of non-digital marketing. They are not analogous across different groups of offline and online channels.
* SEO practice helps facilitate and is part of the race to the bottom - more traffic, more conversions, for cheaper. It is the incremental effort and undertaking to be able to afford better consultants to get more traffic, more conversions, for cheaper...
