Here's some tips for working at an agency.

## Develop a writing practice 	

While there are many hard skills to learn, an underrated skill is being able to write well. 


## Work your proactivity muscle

It's easy to keep your head down and wait to be told what to. Chances are, that won't lead to very interesting work. You're simply along for the ride. Instead go out of your way to find work to get involved in. Ask questions, find new processes, and think up new ideas.

## Be responsible for your own training

While some agencies have better training programs than others, you are ultimately responsible for your own learning.

Carve out time each week to learn, stretch yourself, think about new ideas and processes.


## Advocate for client assignments


If there's a client or industry you really want to work on, advocate for it. 


## Practice speaking

Think of calls with clients as a performance. Actually practice the lines out loud. Imagine the tough questions you'll get and think about what your responses will be. 


## Put yourself on the hook

You'll need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. To be innovative, there may not be a roadmap. If you're being truly innovative, there won't be. Put yourself on the hook to create the roadmap. You'll learn more that way.
