title: Starting out with Stoicism
description: Reflecting on a year of Stoic practice and learning
---
Over the past year, I've read a lot about Stoicism and attempted to implement Stoic practices into my thinking and day-to-day life.

Here are three practices, I've found particularly useful:

1. Perhaps the most well-known and applicable Stoic practice is the delineation between what is in our control and what is not. By delineating in this way, we're able to focus ourselves on what is in our control, while ignoring what is not. After all, if something is not in our control, is it really worth worrying about?
2. Recognizing that I and the people I love are mortal. By noticing and reminding ourselves that our time is finite, it is easier to focus on the present and to make the most of what is most pertinent now.
3. Read and take an active role in learning. There are so many resources out there from virtuous and wise people who came before us. Learning and taking what we're able from them enables us to stand on their shoulders and improve our own practice.
