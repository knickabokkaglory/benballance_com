Interviewing for other jobs when you already have a job can be a seductive distraction. An important skill is being able to tell whether the opportunity is actually excites you or is a relief from the immediate obligations and stressors at your current gig.

What actually excites you about the new opportunity? Will that excitement last or will it fade? 

Throughout my career, I've been distracted by this shiny object syndrome: "if I just get this new gig, I'll be able to do better work." We owe it to ourselves and to our careers to dig in and do the hard work currently in front of us. To only become excited by an opportunity when we are truly wowed by that opportunity.

If the experience throughout the job interview process doesn't wow you, chances are the new job won't wow you either.
