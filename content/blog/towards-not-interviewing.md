description: Focusing efforts on not job interviewing.

The point is that if you are doing work that is valuable and meaningful enough, you should never have to [interview for a job again](https://www.benballance.com/blog/job-interviews/).

Sure, you should talk to the people at a prospective employer, meet potential teammates, get a sense of the culture you are committing to. But keyword-optimizing a resume? That's playing a numbers game that's unlikely to result in a good outcome for you.

If you do the same thing everyone else is, chances are you'll get the same outcomes everyone else does.
